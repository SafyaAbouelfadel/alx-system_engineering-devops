### Postmortem: Service Outage Due to Database Misconfiguration

### Issue Summary
- **Duration of Outage:** 2025-02-28 14:00 UTC to 2025-02-28 16:15 UTC (2 hours, 15 minutes)
- **Impact:** 80% of users were unable to complete transactions, with errors displayed on the checkout page. Users encountered "500 Internal Server Error" messages when attempting to process orders.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the database connection settings caused application requests to fail intermittently.

### Timeline
- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected when monitoring alerts flagged an increase in failed transaction attempts.
- **14:05 UTC:** Engineers identified "500 Internal Server Error" responses in application logs.
- **14:20 UTC:** Investigation focused on the payment processing module, assuming an external payment API outage.
- **14:50 UTC:** Misleading path: External API health checks showed normal behavior.
- **15:10 UTC:** Issue escalated to the Database and DevOps teams.
- **15:30 UTC:** Root cause identified as an incorrect database connection pool configuration causing failed queries.
- **15:50 UTC:** Database connection settings were corrected, and the application was restarted.
- **16:15 UTC:** Full service restored.

### Root Cause and Resolution
#### Root Cause
During a routine database maintenance operation, a configuration change in the database connection pool size was applied incorrectly. This caused some requests to fail due to unavailable connections, leading to transaction failures for users.

#### Resolution
- Database connection settings were updated to use an appropriate pool size based on expected traffic.
- A rollback procedure was implemented for configuration changes to ensure quick reversions in the future.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
#### Improvements
- Implement automated validation for database configuration changes.
- Add real-time monitoring for database connection health.
- Establish a rollback mechanism for configuration changes.
- Improve documentation for database configuration procedures.

#### TODO List
- Develop a script to verify and validate database configuration updates.
- Set up automated alerts for abnormal database connection failures.
- Conduct a full review of all database-related configurations.
- Update internal documentation for handling database maintenance.
- Train the team on best practices for database connection management.

### Issue Illustration
To visualize the problem, hereâ€™s a simple representation of the error flow:

```
[Users] --> [Application Server] --> [Database (Incorrect Pool Config)]
                                      --> [FAILED: Connection Timeout]
```

When the application tried to connect to the database, insufficient connections caused failures:

```
[Users] --> [Application Server] --> [ERROR: 500 Internal Server Error]
```
